/**
 * This enumerator provides a status for Commands, in particular in relation to whether 
 * or not a particular command executed properly (or not). Several member functions 
 * throughout this Commands API use CommandStatus to check whether or not a particular
 * step in executing a command was correctly completed.
 * 
 * The following descriptions are for the various enumerated values declared below
 * SUCCESS    - The job has finished successfully. This is only set when ProcessBuilder returns an
 * 			    exit value of 0, indicating that the job completed normally.
 * PROCESSING - The job is currently processing and setting up information necessary to be
 * 			    able to run, for example, in preparing the CommandConfiguration member variables
 * 				for job execution.
 * RUNNING    - The job is currently running. This is set after configuration is completed correctly
 * 			    and is maintained until the job completes or fails.
 * INFOERROR  - This indicates that there was some information that was not provided that the
 * 			    job needs to run, for example, if the executable could not be found in the
 * 			    working directory in which the user specified. It could also indicate that some of the
 * 				info that was provided was not correct, for example if an incorrect password/username
 * 				was given for a remote command.
 * FAILED     - The job failed. This status is set if the ProcessBuilder returned an atypical
 * 			    exit value (anything other than 0). It is also set if there is any error that
 * 			    is registered during the job running.
 * CANCELED   - The job has been canceled by the user - this is never set unless specified by the 
 * 			    user specifically.
