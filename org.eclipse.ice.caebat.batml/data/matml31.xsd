This version:   MatML Version 3.1, matml31.xsd, October 2004

Schema for MatML, an extensible markup language, or XML, developed especially for the management and interchange of materials information. The history of MatML and examples of use are available at http://www.matml.org.

The MatML schema is not subject to copyright in the United States and is in the public domain. The current schema was edited by the Schema Development Working Group (Doug Fleming Chair, Laura Bartolo, Sally Fahrenholz-Mann, Debbie Mies, Craig Seymour) of the MatML Coordinating Committee (Gil Kaufman and Laura Bartolo Co-Chairs), in association with E. F. Begley.

Prior versions: 
   MatML Version 3.0 Schema in XML Schema Definition language (xsd) format. (December 2002,    Obsolete)
   Annotated MatML DTD Version 2.0 in plain text format. (March 2001, Obsolete)
   Annotated MatML DTD Version 1.0 in plain text format. (April 2000, Obsolete)

Prior versions and revision history are available at http://www.matml.org. Prior versions were authored by E.F. Begley on behalf of the MatML Working Group (1999-2001) and the MatML Steering Committee (2002) and are official contributions of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, which are not subject to copyright in the United States.

			This element declares the content model for PropertyDetails, which
			contains a description of a property referenced by the PropertyData
			element. PropertyDetails has one required attribute, id, which may be

			elsewhere in a MatML document. PropertyDetails also has one optional
			attribute, type, for specifying the type of the property (examples include
			"thermal," "mechanical," "electrical," etc.) PropertyDetails is composed of
			the following elements.

			Name contains the name of the property and has one optional attribute,
			authority, for identifying an authoritative source of property names.
			Name must occur once and only once within the PropertyDetails
			element.

			Units and Unitless are mutually exclusive elements for describing the
			property's units. Units or Unitless must occur once and only once within
			the PropertyDetails element. For additional information, see the
			documentation for the Units and Unitless elements.

			Notes contains any additional information concerning the property and
